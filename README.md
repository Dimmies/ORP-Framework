# Open Roleplay Framework
The Open Roleplay Framework, or O:RP Framework, is an open source roleplay framework developed for the game, Onset. The reason this framework was created was to give people a starting platform for creating servers. With the lack of packages/frameworks released by the community, O:RP was made to hopefully bridge the gap between people creating their own servers and people creating public packages.
